POV: you drank a bit too much caffeine and decided to make a ransomware at 5:47am and then pass out for 14 hours

btw this is pretty shitty so skids cant use it without solving some problems
other than that i spent a solid 2 hours on this. It has:
        A chat feature
        Base64 encryption for the keys
        A popup type shii
        it encrypts everything and i mean EVERYTHING
        DONT USE IT ON YOUR OWN DEVICE, TRUST ME I DID THAT STUPID SHIT.

If you wanna send it to people, i dont condone that shii and this is for "educational purposes"

To send it you need to use pyinstaller so that all the dependcies get downloaded automatically 
im not gonna show how to do it as youtube is a thing.
