# GeminiAicom

An webapp to help cybersecurity engineers with CTFs by providing all the tools and assitance with Gemini AI;

    Features:
        Challenge Categories: Organize tools and resources by challenge type (e.g., cryptography, forensics, web exploitation, reverse engineering, binary exploitation).

        AI Assistance: Integrate AI tools for:
        1. Automated code analysis
        2. Vulnerability detection
        3. Natural Language Processing (NLP) for hint interpretation
        4. Pattern recognition in cryptography challenges

        Toolbox Integration:
        1. Cryptography tools (e.g., hash calculators, encryption/decryption tools)
        2. Forensics tools (e.g., file analysis, memory dump analysis)
        3. Web exploitation tools (e.g., SQLi scanners, XSS scanners)
        4. Reverse engineering tools (e.g., disassemblers, decompilers)
        5. Binary exploitation tools (e.g., buffer overflow testers)
        
        Collaborative Features:
        1. Shared workspaces
        2. Real-time collaboration and chat
        3. Team management
        
        Resource Repository:
        1. Tutorials
        2. Write-ups of past CTFs
        3. Reference materials and documentation
        
        User Management:
        1. Authentication and authorization
